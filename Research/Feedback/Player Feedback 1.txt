Issues

No Game Win screen.
Books on Timers, not long enough to read the whole thing.
Books on Timers, but too long while the timer is still playing in background.
Books on Timers, no control over how long you need to read it.
Game starts without giving the player a chance to read the books.
Very short amount of time to select a book when customer comes in.

Also events occur on click which is unclear to players, suggest making them automatic.
